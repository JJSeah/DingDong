#Ding Dong 
• Description of app
Why do we even need another bus application? We have a wide array of transport applications in the market, but almost none of it serve the purpose of the application: 
To ensure users alight at their right destination. 
Digital distraction is causing 20 million people to miss their bus stops annually, and that continues to increase. How can we stop this from happening? We want our commuters to have an unforgettable journey wherever they go. Hence, we created ‘Ding Dong’. Ding Dong has everything a transport application has, and more. It changes the way we ride our busses, and practically prevents us from missing our stop.
